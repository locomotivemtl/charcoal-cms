Charcoal CMS
============

The CMS Charcoal Module (_Content Management System_). Provides basic objects to build a website.
Notably, `Section` (or _page_), `News`, `Event` and `Faq` as well as to ather user data, notably `ContactInquiry`.

This module is heavily dependant on [`charcoal-object`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-object) (and therefore `charcoal-core`) which provides the base `Content` and `UserData` classes the CMS objects are dependant on.

Adds support for working with [relationships](#relationships) between models using an intermediate object.

# How to install

The preferred (and only supported) way of installing _charcoal-cms_ is with **composer**:

```shell
★ composer require locomotivemtl/charcoal-cms
```

For a complete, ready-to-use project, start from the [`boilerplate`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-project-boilerplate):

```shell
★ composer create-project locomotivemtl/charcoal-project-boilerplate:@dev --prefer-source
```

## Dependencies

-   [`PHP 5.6+`](http://php.net)
    - PHP 7 is recommended for security and performance reasons.
-   [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-attachment`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-attachment)
-   [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-core`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-core)
    - Core charcoal models and storage class.
    - Provides base Model, which depends on Storable and Describable.
-   [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-object`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-object)
-   [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-translator`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-translator)

# Objects

All objects in the `charcoal-cms` module implements `\Charcoal\Object\Content`, which allows to store creation & modification dates. Many objects also implement the `\Charcoal\Object\PublishableInterface`.


-   **Core objects**
    -   [Section](#section-object)
-   **CMS objets**
    -   [Event](#event-object)
    -   [FAQ](#faq-object)
    -   [News](#news-object)

# Core objects

-   [Section](#section-object)

## Section object

A **section**, in Charcoal, is a reachable page on the website, as part of the full hierarchical site map. They can be displayed in menus or breadcrumbs and be reached with a unique URL (`routable`).

Types of sections:

-   `blocks`
    -   Blocks sections define their content as a structured map of blocks.
-   `content`
    -   Content sections define their content in a single, simple _HTML_ property.
-   `empty`
    -   Empty sections are linked to a template but do not require any custom content.
-   `external`
    -   External sections are simply a redirect to an external (or internal) URL.

All section types, except _external_, make use of a `Template` object to be rendered. Typically, a charcoal `view` make sure of linking the `template` (by default, _mustache_

> Sections are standard Charcoal `Model`, meaning they are _describable_ with a `Metadata` object (which define a map of `properties`) and _storable_ with a `Source` object.

Base section properties:

| Name                 | L10n | Type      | Description |
| -------------------- | :--: | --------- | ----------- |
| **title**            | ✔    | string    |
| **subtitle**         | ✔    | html      |
| **template_ident**   |      | string    |
| **template_options** |      | structure |
| **attachments**      | ✔    | multi-object |

Extra _blocks_ properties:

| Name                 | L10n | Type      | Description |
| -------------------- | :--: | --------- | ----------- |
| **blocks**           | ✔    | structure |

Extra _content_ properties:

| Name                 | L10n | Type | Description |
| -------------------- | :--: | ---- | ----------- |
| **content**          | ✔    | html |

Extra _external_ properties:

| Name                 | L10n | Type | Description |
| -------------------- | :--: | ---- | ----------- |
| **external_url**     | ✔    | url  |

<small>Note that `external` sections ignore the _template\_ident_ & _template\_options_ properties as well as the _metatags_ set of properties.</small>

--

Because _sections_ extends `\Charcoal\Object\Content`, they also have the following standard properties:

| Name                  | L10n | Type | Description |
| --------------------- | :--: | ---- | ----------- |
| **id<sup>1</sup>**    |      |
| **active**            |      |
| **position**          |      |
| **created**           |      |
| **created_by**        |      |
| **last_modified**     |      |
| **last\_modified_by** |      |

<small>[1] By default, the **key** of the section is the **id**.</small>.

--

_Sections_ are hierarchical. They can be indented inside one another to create multi-dimensional site maps. The additional properties are therefore available:

| Name                 | L10n | Type | Description |
| -------------------- | :--: | ---- | ----------- |
| **master**           |      |

The hierarchical interface (`\Charcoal\Object\HierarchicalInterface`) also provide the following methods, amongst others:

-   `hierarchy()`
-   `children()`
-   `siblings()`

--

_Sections_ have _metatags_.

| Name                 | L10n | Type   | Description |
| -------------------- | :--: | ------ | ----------- |
| **meta_title**       | ✔    | string |
| **meta_description** | ✔    | text   |
| **meta_image**       | ✔    | image  |
| **meta_author**      | ✔    | string |

...and more specialized properties, for _facebook_ / _opengraph_.

__

Like all _Content_ objects, _sections_ implement the `\Charcoal\Object\RevisionableInterface`, which tracks all save / update into _revisions_.

### Extending the section object

The `\Charcoal\Cms\Section\*` objects are `final`. To extend, use the `\Charcoal\Cms\AbstractSection` base object instead, to make sure no metadata conflicts arise.

-   [Widgets](#widgets)
-   [Configuration](#configuration)
-   [Usage](#usage)

## Concept

A **source** model has one or many relationships with a **target** model. These relationships are stored in an intermediate **pivot** model.

## Models

The `Pivot` Model extends `AbstractModel` and implements some new properties:

    - `source_object_id`
    - `source_object_type`
    - `target_object_id`
    - `target_object_type`

## Widgets

The module provides its own Admin widgets namespaced as `Charcoal\Admin\Widget\Relation`.

## Configuration

Add the View paths in `config/config.json`.
```json
"view": {
    "paths": [
        "...",
        "vendor/locomotivemtl/charcoal-cms/templates/"
    ]
}
```

## Usage

Your models need to know that they may have relationships to other models. To do that, use and implement the `PivotAware` concept:
```php
use Charcoal\Relation\Interfaces\PivotAwareInterface;
use Charcoal\Relation\Traits\PivotAwareTrait;
```

In your **source** model metadata, add the widget configuration in the default form group (see example below).
```json
"forms": {
    "default": {
        "groups": {
            "target_object_pivot_group": {
                "priority": 10,
                "show_header": false,
                "title": "Target Objects",
                "type": "charcoal/admin/widget/relation/form-group/pivot",
                "template": "charcoal/admin/widget/relation/form-group/pivot",
                "target_object_type": "my/namespace/target-object-type"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To create a new `Pivot` model, your **target** model needs to provide a quick form.
```json
"forms": {
    "project_name.quick": {
        "group_display_mode": "tab",
        "groups": {
            "body": {
                "title": "Target Object Information",
                "show_header": false,
                "properties": [
                    "title"
                ],
                "layout": {
                    "structure": [
                        { "columns": [ 1 ] }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
},
"default_quick_form": "project_name.quick",
```

Hooks allow the **source** model to remove unnecessary relationships when deleted.
```php
public function preDelete()
{
    // PivotAwareTrait
    $this->removePivots();
    return parent::preDelete();
}
```

## Coding Style

The Charcoal-App module follows the Charcoal coding-style:

-   [_PSR-1_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md)
-   [_PSR-2_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
-   [_PSR-4_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md), autoloading is therefore provided by _Composer_.
-   [_phpDocumentor_](http://phpdoc.org/) comments.
-   Read the [phpcs.xml](phpcs.xml) file for all the details on code style.

> Coding style validation / enforcement can be performed with `composer phpcs`. An auto-fixer is also available with `composer phpcbf`.
